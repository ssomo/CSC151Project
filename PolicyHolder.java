//Create a policy holder class that will represent a person that 
//is associated with an insurance policy.

//Move the appropriate fields and methods of the Policy class into the PolicyHolder class 
//(Hint: the fields and methods you move into the PolicyHolder class should be directly associated with a policy holder).

//Add a toString method to both the Policy and PolicyHolder classes.

//Add a static field that is used to keep track of the number of Policy objects that have been created.

//Demonstrate proper use of class collaboration in such a way that a Policy has a PolicyHolder.

//Alter the Demo class to implicitly call the toString method you created in Step 2 when outputting information about the Policy objects.

//The demo program should display the number of Policy objects that were created, the number of Policyholders that are smokers, and the number of Policyholders that are non-smokers.
